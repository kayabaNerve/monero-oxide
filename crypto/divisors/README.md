# Elliptic Curve Divisors

An implementation of a representation for and construction of elliptic curve
divisors, intended for Eagen's [EC IP work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/596).

An initial version of this library was written by kayabaNerve, before the
Monero project hosted a
[contest](https://getmonero.org/2025/04/05/fcmp++-contest.html) for optimized
versions of the library. [fabrizio-m](https://github.com/fabrizio-m) submitted
a much faster library, which is the basis of the current library today.

Potential future improvements, as noted by fabrizio-m, may be found
[here](https://github.com/fabrizio-m/fcmp-competition/blob/notes/ec-divisors-contest/ec-divisors-contest-src/notes.md).
