/// Calculates the Merkle root for the given leaves.

/// Equivalent to `tree_hash` in monero-core:
/// https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/893916ad091a92e765ce3241b94e706ad012b62a
///   /src/crypto/tree-hash.c#L62
///
/// Monero's Merkle trees have two notable properties:
///  1) Merkle trees are unbalanced, causing each leaf to only be included once with a unique
///     index, without introducing padding.
///  2) The leaves of a Merkle tree are not distinguished from its branches. This would allow
///     proving a branch as a leaf, or claiming a leaf is a branch. In order to safely perform
///     proofs with a tree's root, the amount of leaves within the Merkle tree MUST be known.
///     Thankfully, Monero uses this to commit to the transactions within a block when calculating
///     its hash, and the amount of transactions is additionally committed to. Alternatively, one
///     could assume every valid transaction's serialization will be longer than 64 bytes.
///
/// This function accepts a mutable slice for the leaves, using it as scratch space for the
/// computation of the leaves. The value of this scratch space is undefined after the operation
/// completes.
///
/// This function returns [`None`] if the tree is empty and [`Some`](_) otherwise.
