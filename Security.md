## Bugs Which Are Security Issues

Bugs in monero-oxide which cause a downstream project to be at risk of loss of
funds, impact users' privacy, risk a Denial of Service, or are similarly
problematic issues, should be reported via
[monero-oxide's Bug Bounty Program](
  https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/monero-oxide/information/
). This bug bounty was generously sponsored by
[Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/) who directly handles payouts.
Alternatively, for users without Immunefi accounts, security issues may be
reported via [GitHub](https://github.com/monero-oxide/monero-oxide/security),
or as a manner of _least preference_, a maintainer (as listed in our
[Governance document](/Governance.md)) may be messaged over Matrix.

Public disclosure, such as opening a GitHub issue, is not responsible and
_MUST NOT_ be done. If you are struggling to make a disclosure, please ask for
help to do so (even if in a GitHub issue, if necessary) _without_ publishing
_any_ details about the intended disclosure (e.g. its estimated severity).

All affected projects should be _privately_ disclosed to via their stated
disclosure method (or any private means of communication upon lack of stated
disclosure method).

All projects, including monero-oxide, should be informed of if multiple
projects were disclosed to, without permission to make a public disclosure
until all projects resolve the issue.

## Bugs Which Aren't Security Issues

Bugs without a impact to the project's security, nor a reasonable consumer's
security, should be reported via
[monero-oxide's GitHub issues](
  https://github.com/monero-oxide/monero-oxide/issues
). If you're unsure if a bug impacts security, or to what degree it does, it
must be treated as having its highest potential severity.

## Fallback Disclosure Timeline

Any bug within monero-oxide may be publicly disclosed three months after the
date of its responsible disclosure to the monero-oxide project, regardless of
its status. Prior to this deadline, any disclosed-to party may request an
extension of up to 60 days. If the discloser agrees to that extension, they must
notify all disclosed-to parties of the new timeline and all must honor it. If
the discloser does not agree, they must explicitly inform the requester of their
disagreement.
